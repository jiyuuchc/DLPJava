A java wrapper for PortabilityLayer.dll, the library for controlling DLP Light Commander (http://www.ti.com/tool/dlplightcommander).
Both the header file (PortabilityLayer.h) and the dll file (PortabilityLayer.dll) should be copied to the current folder before attemp to build the package.

The package requires SWIG (http://www.swig.org/) to build.

The generated JAVA code is included in package jar file: DLPJava-sources.jar

The jar file implements a java package: edu.uchc.DLPJava.

A new dll file will be generated (DLPJava.dll), which is required by the JAVA code.
